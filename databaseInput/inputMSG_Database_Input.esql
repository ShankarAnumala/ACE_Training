/*
 * This DatabaseEvent module implements the ESQL code invoked from a DatabaseInput node to handle
 * events as they move through the states of New->Ready->Dispatched->Complete.
 *
 * NOTE: Events that result in unhandled exceptions in the message flow are moved to the Failed
 * state. "Unhandled" means either that the catch terminal was not wired, or that the catch
 * terminal threw an exception.  If an exception is unhandled, the transaction is rolled back.
 * If the exception is handled, even if it is handled on the catch terminal, the transaction is
 * committed.
 *
 * Events are moved to the Failed state after rollback (or after a number of retries, depending 
 * on the settings on the Retry panel).  Events in the Failed state are propagated to the Failure
 * terminal.  If they are not handled on the failure terminal, they are discarded.  They are
 * still in the EventTable, and so are not lost.
 *
 * If you are using a database table as your event store, you can convert this template to deployable
 * code by replacing the substitution strings. Substitution strings in this module are enclosed by
 * < and > characters.
 * The following substitution strings are used:
 *   <MySchemaName>                 - the database schema name.
 *   <MyEventTableName>             - the database table used as your event store.
 *   <MyEventTablePrimaryKey>       - the primary key of the database table used as the event store.
 *   <MyStatusColumnName>           - the name of a column, if you update a column in the event table
 *                                    to indicate that the event has been processed.
 *                                    If you delete events from the event table after processing, you
 *                                    do not need <MyStatusColumnName>.
 *   <MyNewEventStatusValue>        - the value written to the status column when the event is first
 *                                    added. You need this only if you use <MyStatusColumnName>.
 *   <MyProcessedEventStatusValue>  - the value written to the status column after the event has been
 *                                    processed. You need this only if you use <MyStatusColumnName>.
 *   <MyApplicationTableName>       - the name of the table that includes the changed data to be processed
 *                                    by the DatabaseInput node.
 *   <MyEventTableForeignKey>       - the column in the event table that references the row in the application
 *                                    table containing the changed data to be processed by the DatabaseInput
 *                                    node. This is typically the primary key of the application table.
 *   <MyApplicationTablePrimaryKey> - the primary key of the database table used as the application table.
 * When you have finished editing the ESQL, set the data source and ESQL module properties on the basic tab
 * of this node.

	 * Parameters:

	 *                          Each child must include a 'Usr' field and a 'Key' field, with the

		 * Under certain circumstances, for example, if you do not need assured delivery of the
		 * events, it is acceptable to update or delete the events here. This means that
		 * the deletion or update is committed before the message flow processes the in-memory
		 * copies of these events. If the broker, execution group, or message flow is stopped
		 * or redeployed in the meantime, the in-memory copy is lost, and the events are never
		 * processed by the flow.
		 *
		 * NOTE: You do not need to filter out events that are currently dispatched here.
		 *       The framework ensures that events are not duplicated by comparing the 'Key' field
		 *       to the 'Key' field of dispatched events.
